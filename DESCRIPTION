Description: 
    Implements automated cell type annotation for single-cell RNA-seq data
    using multiple large language models (LLMs). Provides unified interface
    for model integration, parallel processing, and consensus prediction.
    Supports both major cell type classification and fine-grained subtype
    identification through cross-model voting mechanism. Includes built-in
    visualization tools for annotation validation.
